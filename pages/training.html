<h2>Training in programming and data analysis</h2>

<h2>The Carpentries Foundation</h2>

<div class="">

<img class="img-training"  src="../images/carpentries.png" alt="Carpentries Foundation badge"> <br>

The <a href="https://carpentries.org/">Carpentries Foundation</a> is the umbrella organisation that harbors the Data Carpentry, Software Carpentry and the Library Carpentry daughter organisations.
They teach scientific programming and data analysis to researchers with an emphasis on the good practices for over 20 years now.
The Carpentries Foundation is dedicated to teaching professionals "good enough practices" that can be readily implemented into their daily work.
While the Software Carpentry part is teaching researchers the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain,
the Data Carpentry aims to teach fundamental concepts, skills and tools for working more effectively with data.
With more than 1300 workshops taught in 50 countries, the Carpentries Foundation is one of the most acknowledged and state-of-the-art training organisation
that offers data and programming workshops to professionals.

<h2>An official instructor of the Carpentries Foundation</h2>
I have become an official Carpentry Instructor in July 2018 (<a href="../certificate_galland_marc.pdf">you can see my certificate here</a>).
Since 2016, I have been regularly involved in Data Carpentry and Software Carpentries either through workshop hosting
(making sure that every practical aspects is taken care of),
through helping with the organization (recruiting helpers, updating the website) or
through teaching specific lessons. You can find a list of official
If you wish to organize a Software or Data Carpentry workshops ()

I also organise and teach various tailor-made workshops on different topics such as RNA-Seq, metagenomics or

  <li>February 2019, Wageningen: <a href="https://nioo-knaw.github.io/2019-02-05-wageningen-genomics/">Data Carpentry Genomics</a>. 30 participants. Teaching.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Community lead</h2>
Since March 2017, I lead a Mozilla Science Lab Study Group in Amsterdam. It has the aim to
improve the quality of data analysis & code executed during research as well as to spread
good practices among Life Scientists. My role is to gather Life Scientists from various levels
whose research involve data analysis and programming. Usually scattered around the institute,
gathering forces help to share good practices, learn new "tricks",
debug and improve each other's code as well as proving that scientific programming can be a fun, social and inclusive
experience. Find out more <a href="www.mgalland.info">on my personal website</a> and on
