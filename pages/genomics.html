<h2>Genomic & omics analyses</h2>
<div>
  <p>
  Helping you to get access to the latest development
  in Next-Generation Sequencing technologies
  as well as in various "omics" techniques.

  Some examples include:

  <ul>
    <li> <strong>Transcriptomics through RNA-Seq: </strong>Transcriptomics through RNA-Seq (messenger RNA, small RNAs).
    <li> <strong>Mapping-by-Sequencing:</strong> finding the genomic regions related to a trait of interest based on Next-Generation Sequencing (i.e. Genotyping-by-Sequencing).
    <li> <strong>Analysis of "omics" data:</strong> finding biomarkers related to a phenotype of interest (disease resistance, abiotic stress resistance, etc.). 
  </ul>
