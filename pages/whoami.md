<h2>A scientist fascinated by plants</h2>
<div class="clearfix">
<img class="img-whoiam" src="../images/marc_galland.jpeg" alt="Picture">
<p><strong>2006-2009:</strong> I obtained a PhD in Plant Molecular Biology on the role of the ethylene signalling pathway in plant-PGPR interaction (2006-2009, University of Montpellier, France). This gave me a strong background in common tools used on the <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em>a model plant species (PCR, qPCR, genotyping, mutant analysis, etc.). <br> 
<strong>2010-2014:</strong> Following my PhD, I studied seed germination using "omics" techniques (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) at the Jean-Pierre Bourgin Institute (INRA Versailles, France). I worked on both basic research (Arabidopsis seed germination) and applied research (NUTRICE project to develop innovative rice cookers). There, I started to learn about data analysis using R and RStudio.<br>
<strong>2014-2017:</strong> I started a second post-doctoral position at the University of Amsterdam to improve tomato's resistance to insect pests using RNA-Seq and metabolomic datasets 
   I Marie-Curie Sklodowska Individual Fellowship to train myself thoroughly in bioinformatics and other related genomics techniques 
followed by a postdoctorate position in Amsterdam (The Netherlands). <br>
<strong>2017-present:</strong> Presently, I  work part-time at the University of Amsterdam as a Community Lead to animate a community of computational biologists. In the course of this work, I provide support in Data Science and Data Stewardship to wet-lab biologists that have little knowledge in programming and data analysis. <br>

<h2>A plant biologist passionate about the next genomic frontiers</h2>

<h2>A recent entrepreneur, founder of BioData Services</h2>
<div class="clearfix">
	<p>On the 1st of February 2018, I have founded the BioData Services company to support small and medium-size plant breeding companies for their needs in bioinformatics & genomics analyses. I also provide help to build breeding databases to manage plant breeder germplasm.On the academic side, I train life scientists by organizing Software/Data Carpentry training workshops.</p>
