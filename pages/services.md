    <p>To help you to deal with the analysis of Next-Generation Sequencing data, my company can perform the most common genomic analyses:</p>
    <ul class="list-services">
    	<li>SNP calling: detection of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms and small InDels (insertions/deletions)</li>
    	<li>RNA-Seq: quantification of gene expression using parallel (typically using one Illumina HiSeq solutions)</li>
    	<li>Genome sequencing and assembly</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My genomic pipelines are developped with the <a class="hover" href="https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Snakemake</a> workflow manager under the <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0"> GNU General Public License v3.0 </a>. These pipelines can be delivered with the full configuration as an extra-option. Together with my training expertise, I can therefore help you to become autonomous for future genomic analyses.</p>
